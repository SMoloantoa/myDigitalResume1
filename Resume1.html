        <p><h4><u>INTRODUCTION</h4></u>
            <em>Over the last four years I have continuously strived to gain and improve my knowledge throughout all aspects of the web. I first studied HTML and CSS through a YouTube channel named thenewboston; the tutorials that were provided helped to give me a foundation which I could later build upon. Using this channel I also went on to gain a basic understanding of programming using the C++ and Java programming languages.</em>
